				<p class="intro">Experts have been predicting the rise of remote work for years now, and the movement is making strides as more and more companies are hiring remotely than ever before. The prominence of technology andcommunication tools means it’s easier than ever to manage a remote team successfully.</p>

			<h2>Access to Global Talent</h2>
			<p>Companies with physical locations are limited to hiring a team within the proximity of one of their offices or acquiring relocation fees for employees in other areas. Businesses who hire remotely are never defined by a local talent pool because they can recruit team members from anywhere in the world. Location does not affect the hiring process and gives employers access to talented people that they would have more difficulty hiring if they had a physical office.</p>
			<p>Business can benefit from this in innumerable ways as they begin to grow and build their team. Creating the right team is imperative in maintaining growth and scalability, and when hiring remotely, companies can ensure that they are not settling for the best talent in their area, but the best talent across the globe. </p>

			<h2>Increased Productivity</h2>
			<p>A common objection to remote work is that workers are more likely to get distracted when working in an environment outside of an office. However, research shows that remote employees are just as productive, if not more so than their in-office counterparts. A survey conducted by Global Workplace Analytics shows that 24% of remote workers accomplished more tasks during their shifts than a traditional office employee.</p>
			<p>It’s true that remote workers are exposed to more distractions when you take things like last-minute meetings, watercooler chats, or other office happenings out of the equation, there seems to be a similar amount of distractions regardless of environment. This is why it’s critical for management to establish a culture of open communication and deep work practices that encourages autonomy and productivity. </p>
